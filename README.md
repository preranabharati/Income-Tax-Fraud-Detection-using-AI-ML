# Income-Tax-Fraud-Detection-using-AI-ML

This project investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine 
Learning (ML) methodologies to identify potential instances of income tax fraud. The 
escalating challenge of tax evasion necessitates the adoption of advanced technologies to 
enhance early detection and prevention mechanisms. The study delves into the 
development and evaluation of predictive models trained on diverse financial datasets, 
aiming to accurately assess reported income against actual income (predicted income).
Various supervised learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting, are 
employed to predict individuals' actual income based on reported financial information. 
Feature engineering techniques, including label encoding and standardization, are applied 
to optimize the models' performance.
The project encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and 
correlation analysis to ensure the dataset's quality. Model evaluations, utilizing standard 
metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared on a test set, provide valuable 
insights into the accuracy and reliability of the models.
The user interface for the Income Tax Fraud Detection system is implemented through 
Streamlit, allowing users to input various financial parameters for predictions. The report 
concludes with the identification of the best-performing model, which is subsequently 
deployed for real-time fraud detection.
This research contributes to fortifying financial systems against fraudulent activities by 
leveraging the capabilities of AI and ML. The findings offer significant insights into the 
feasibility and effectiveness of predictive analytics for income tax fraud detection. 
Notably, XGBoost demonstrates exceptional accuracy, achieving 0.9973, surpassing all 
other models, which have a combined average accuracy of 0.7437.
